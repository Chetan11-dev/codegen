Parser accepts some input
iterates 
detects state func / cl 
change to corresponding state 
if func reads correspongin lines  
if meth reads correspongin feilds and meth
In meths parses it and turns to object of method 
`` feilds
attaches options at end by checking for undefinity
returns on object that either contains 
 detected anything : bool
 class : Class
 funcs : Meths[]
 errors: num[]

```
string -> ob 
filter 

```
in capturing just focus on capture 
after captured proactively check for state if class in case make a justcaptured func that inverts itself 
if class 
    finding feilds
    finding meths

in class check for 
    next feild if meth/param 
    make it justcaptured
